# Financial Comparison Tool

This application allows users to compare financial data of different governmental entities in Switzerland (e.g., municipalities, cantons). The tool provides visual insights into how entities generate and allocate their resources, enabling transparent, accessible, and meaningful comparisons.

## Live Demo

The application is deployed and can be visited at: **https://gdn.gitu.cc/**

## Features

- Compare financial data between different municipalities
- View data for different years
- Scale data to match totals for better comparison
- Visual representation of financial data

## Data Loading

The application loads data at compile time rather than through the GUI. This approach has several advantages:

1. **Faster startup**: Data is bundled with the application, eliminating the need for users to upload files
2. **Consistent data**: All users see the same data, ensuring consistent comparisons
3. **Version control**: Data is versioned along with the code
4. **Simplified user experience**: Users don't need to know which files to upload

### Data Preparation

The data is split into smaller files based on municipality and year to make it easier to manage and load. A Node.js script is provided to automate this process:

```bash
# Run the data splitting script
node scripts/split-csv.js
```

This script:
1. Reads the source CSV files from `src/data/`
2. Splits them by municipality and year
3. Saves the resulting files in `src/data/split/`

The application then loads these split files at compile time using Vite's import mechanism.

### Adding New Data

To add new data to the application:

1. Place the new CSV files in the `src/data/` directory
2. Run the data splitting script to process the new files
3. Update the `availableMunicipalities` and `availableYears` arrays in `src/utils/DataLoader.ts` if necessary
4. Rebuild the application

The application will automatically use the latest year's data by default, with the option to switch to older data.

## Implementation Details

### Data Loading Mechanism

The application uses a compile-time data loading mechanism implemented in `src/utils/DataLoader.ts`. This module:

1. Provides functions to access data for different municipalities and years
2. Automatically determines the latest available year
3. Loads data from pre-split CSV files

In a production environment, you would use Vite's `import.meta.glob` feature to dynamically import all CSV files:

```typescript
// Example of how to dynamically import all municipality files
const municipalityFiles = import.meta.glob('../data/split/gemeinde/*.csv', { eager: true });

// Example of how to dynamically import all year-municipality files
const yearMunicipalityFiles = import.meta.glob('../data/split/jahr_gemeinde/**/*.csv', { eager: true });
```

### Project Structure

- `src/components/`: React components
- `src/utils/`: Utility functions, including the DataLoader
- `src/types/`: TypeScript type definitions
- `src/data/`: Source data files
  - `src/data/split/`: Split data files (generated by the script)
- `scripts/`: Utility scripts, including the data splitting script

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend updating the configuration to enable type-aware lint rules:

```js
export default tseslint.config({
  extends: [
    // Remove ...tseslint.configs.recommended and replace with this
    ...tseslint.configs.recommendedTypeChecked,
    // Alternatively, use this for stricter rules
    ...tseslint.configs.strictTypeChecked,
    // Optionally, add this for stylistic rules
    ...tseslint.configs.stylisticTypeChecked,
  ],
  languageOptions: {
    // other options...
    parserOptions: {
      project: ['./tsconfig.node.json', './tsconfig.app.json'],
      tsconfigRootDir: import.meta.dirname,
    },
  },
})
```

You can also install [eslint-plugin-react-x](https://github.com/Rel1cx/eslint-react/tree/main/packages/plugins/eslint-plugin-react-x) and [eslint-plugin-react-dom](https://github.com/Rel1cx/eslint-react/tree/main/packages/plugins/eslint-plugin-react-dom) for React-specific lint rules:

```js
// eslint.config.js
import reactX from 'eslint-plugin-react-x'
import reactDom from 'eslint-plugin-react-dom'

export default tseslint.config({
  plugins: {
    // Add the react-x and react-dom plugins
    'react-x': reactX,
    'react-dom': reactDom,
  },
  rules: {
    // other rules...
    // Enable its recommended typescript rules
    ...reactX.configs['recommended-typescript'].rules,
    ...reactDom.configs.recommended.rules,
  },
})
```
