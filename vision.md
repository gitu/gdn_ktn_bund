## **Project Requirements: Interactive Government Finance Comparison Website**

### **1. Project Overview**

The goal is to create an easy-to-use, interactive website that allows users to compare the financial data of different governmental entities in Switzerland (e.g., villages, cities, cantons). The platform should provide visual insights into how entities generate and allocate their resources, enabling transparent, accessible, and meaningful comparisons.

### **2. Core Features**

#### **2.1 Entity Comparison**

* Allow users to select **two or more entities** (villages, cities, cantons).
* Enable comparison across **key financial indicators**, such as:

    * Revenue sources (e.g., taxes, transfers, fees)
    * Expenditure categories (e.g., education, health, infrastructure)
    * Budget vs actuals (if available)
    * Debt level and reserves
    * Per capita metrics

#### **2.2 Cantonal Context**

* Include **cantonal-level financial data** as contextual information for each entity.
* Allow comparison **within a canton**, **between cantons**, or **across the entire country**.

#### **2.3 Visualizations**

* Support **interactive graphs** such as:

    * Bar charts, pie charts, and stacked bar charts
    * Line charts (for trends over time)
    * Maps with color-coded overlays (e.g., tax rates, expenditures per capita)
* Users should be able to:

    * Hover for tooltips
    * Click to filter or drill down
    * Export charts as images or PDF

#### **2.4 Data Sources and Updates**

* Import data from **official finance statistics** (e.g., BFS, cantonal databases).
* Data must be **updated regularly** (e.g., annually or as published).
* Show the **source and date** of each data set clearly.

* Simple and intuitive layout:

    * Clear navigation

* Data visualization using D3.js, Chart.js or similar
* Optional: Map integration using Leaflet or Mapbox
